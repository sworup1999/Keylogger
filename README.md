# Keylogger
* Keylogger is a simple Python script developed by Sworup Kumar Sahu to capture and log keystrokes. This tool demonstrates basic keylogging techniques and is intended for educational purposes.

# Features
* Keystroke Logging: Captures all keyboard inputs, including regular keys and special keys.
* File Output: Logs captured keystrokes to a file named ``` keylog.py.```
* Special Key Handling: Recognizes and logs special keys like space, enter, and tab.

# Installation

```
# Install Dependencies:
* Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required library:
* ```

  ```
# Usage
* Run the script to start logging keystrokes:
```
python keylogger.py
